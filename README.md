#CrackingTheCodingInterview
## CTCI Solutions - Fatimah Areola

## Hi, I'm Fatimah!
I'm working through Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle McDowell, and am keeping up this repository and a central place for my solutions. This way I can go back and improve on previous solutions as I learn more. Feel free to reach out if you have any feedback on how an aspiring software developper can improve her skills!

## Build Status
Still in progress! If you have any advice or feedback for this project please let me know!
